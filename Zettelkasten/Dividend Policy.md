## Dividend Policy Theories
1. Walter's Method (1)
	1. Growth firms IRR>Cost, Payout ratio 0
	2. Declining firms IRR<Cost, Payout ratio 100%
	3. NormaI firms IRR=Cost, Payout variable
	4. Assumptions: (*ICIC 100%*)
		1. All financing through retained earning, none external
		2. IRR & Cost of capital are constant irrespective of investment changes
		3. Earnings are fully retained OR fully distributed
		4. Constant EPS and DIV
		5. Infinite life of company
	5. Criticism:
		1. No External Financing
		2. Constant IRR and cost of capital
	6. Formula: $$\frac{D}{k} + \frac{(E-D) * \frac{r}{k}}{k}$$
2. Gordon's Model (2)
	1. Growth firms IRR > Cost, Share Price ^ with retention ratio ^
	2. Declining forms IRR < Cost, Share Price v with retention ratio ^
	3. Normal firms IRR = Cost, No impact on share policy by dividend policy
	4. Assumptions:
		1. Internal Financing
		2. Const IRR, Cost of Cap
		3. Const retention ratio
		4. Const rate of growth
		5. Infinite life
		6. No taxes
		7. Capital cost > rate of growth
	5. Criticism/Limitations:
		1. No external financing
		2. Constant IRR and cost of capital
	6. Formula: $$\frac{E(1-b)}{k-g}$$
4. Modigliani Miller Approach (3)
